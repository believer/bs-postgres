## bs-postgres

Still super early development and trying stuff out. Comparing to what's been done in [scull7/bs-mysql2](https://github.com/scull7/bs-mysql2) as there are some similarities between the libraries.

It should handle `SELECT` and `INSERT` with params at the moment. See [Demo.re](https://github.com/believer/bs-postgres/blob/master/src/Demo.re) for an example.

Any help is greatly appreciated!
